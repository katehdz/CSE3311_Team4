Input Validation Utilities

This module provides validation functions for the Club House System.

- Email format validation
- Student ID format validation
- Club name validation
- Role validation
- Data sanitization functions

Future implementations could include:
- validate_email(email: str) -> bool
- validate_student_id(student_id: str) -> bool
- sanitize_input(text: str) -> str
- validate_club_name(name: str) -> bool
- validate_member_role(role: str) -> bool
